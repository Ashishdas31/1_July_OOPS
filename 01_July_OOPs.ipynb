    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system using the concept of \"objects.\"\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the organization of code and data around the idea of objects, which are instances of classes.\n",
    "The main goals of OOP include:\n",
    "1.Modularity and Reusability: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating data and behavior within objects. This makes it easier to manage and maintain large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes that represent real-world objects or concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class (superclass or base class). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class."
